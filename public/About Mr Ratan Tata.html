                    Ratan Tata was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), during the British Raj, into a Parsi Zoroastrian family,
                    on
                    28 December 1937. He was the son of Naval Tata (who was born in Surat and later adopted into the
                    Tata family), and Soonoo Tata (the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata). Tata's biological
                    grandfather, Hormusji Tata was a member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his
                    parents separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and
                    widow of Ratanji Tata.He had a younger brother Jimmy Tata and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from
                    Naval Tata's second marriage to his stepmother Simone Tata.

                    Tata studied at the Campion School, Mumbai until 8th grade. He then continued his studies at the
                    Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and the Riverdale
                    Country School in New York City, from which he graduated in 1955.After high school, Tata
                    enrolled in Cornell University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in architecture in
                    1962. While at Cornell, Tata became a member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. In 1975, Tata
                    enrolled in the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School (HBS).In 2008, Tata gifted
                    Cornell $50 million, becoming the largest international donor in the university's history.Tata
                    also donated $50 million to Harvard Business School, Harvard University to establish an executive
                    center, which is now called Tata Hall that supports over 9,000 executive education students each
                    year.

                    In 2004 Tata met architect A. Quincy Jones who spent three weeks as architecture design critic at
                    Cornell. After completing Cornell, Tata briefly joined Jones at his firm Jones & Emmons in Los
                    Angeles.While Tata was planning to settle in Los Angeles, he was called back to India by his
                    grandmother.

                    In the 1970s, Ratan Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial
                    success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it
                    collapse during an economic slowdown.In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of
                    Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of
                    various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure.
                    In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the
                    implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and
                    requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised
                    innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent.Under his leadership,
                    overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the
                    group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.<br><br>

                    During the 45 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenue grew over 40 times, and profit over 50
                    times. When he took over the company, sales overwhelmingly comprised commodity sales, but at the
                    end of his tenure, the majority of sales came from brands. He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley,
                    Tata Motors acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned
                    Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% of revenues coming
                    from operations and sales internationally.<br><br>

                    He also conceptualised and spearheaded the development of the Tata Nano car after the grand success
                    of Diesel Tata Indica, which helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian
                    consumer. Tata Motors has since rolled out the first batch of Tigor Electric Vehicles from
                    its Sanand Plant in Gujarat, which Tata has described as to "fast-forward India's electric
                    dream."<br><br>

                    Upon turning 75, Ratan Tata resigned his executive powers in the Tata group on 28 December 2012. An
                    ensuing leadership crisis over his succession drew intense media scrutiny. The board of
                    directors of the company appointed his successor, Cyrus Mistry, a relative of Tata and the son of
                    Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which was the largest individual shareholder of the
                    Tata group. On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons, and Ratan
                    Tata was made interim chairman. A selection committee, which included Tata as a member, was formed
                    to find a successor. On 12 January 2017, Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the chairman of
                    Tata Sons, a role he assumed in February 2017. In February 2017, Mistry was removed as a director
                    for Tata Sons. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal later found in December 2019 that the
                    removal of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons was illegal, and ordered that he be
                    reinstated.On appeal, India's Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Cyrus Mistry.<br><br>

                    Tata had also invested in multiple companies with his own wealth. He had invested in Snapdeal – one
                    of India's leading e-commerce websites. In January 2016, he invested in Teabox, an online premium
                    Indian Tea seller,and CashKaro.com, a discount coupons and cash-back website.He had made
                    small investments in both early and late stage companies in India, such as INR 0.95 Cr in Ola
                    Cabs.In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone
                    startup Xiaomi.In 2016, he invested in Nestaway an online real-estate portal that later
                    acquired Zenify to start the online real-estate and pet-care portal, Dogspot.Tata
                    also launched a companionship startup for senior citizens named Goodfellows, to encourage
                    intergenerational friendships.<br><br>

                Tata never married and had no children. In 2011, he stated, "I came close to getting married four times
                and each time I backed off in fear or for one reason or another." He was a devotee of Sathya Sai
                Baba, having first met him in 2009, and got involved in multiple projects initiated by the Guru. 

                Tata was admitted to Breach Candy Hospital in critical condition and was under intensive care.He
                died there at 23:30 IST on 9 October 2024, at the age of 86 due to age-related issues.Following
                his death, the Government of Maharashtra and the Government of Jharkhand announced a day of mourning.

                On 10 October, Tata was given a state funeral.[84] His last rites were conducted at the parsi
                crematorium at Worli. He was accorded with military and 21-gun salute during his final rites.
                Mumbai Police delivered a ceremonial guard of honour and his body was wrapped in the Indian flag.
                Even after death, Tata donated ₹10,000cr in his will which includes his mentee Shantanu Naidu.
